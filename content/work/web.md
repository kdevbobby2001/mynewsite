Web development is the process of creating interactive and dynamic software applications that operate through web browsers. This involves a combination of frontend development, focusing on user interfaces and experiences, and backend development, managing server-side logic and database functionality. Web apps are accessible across various devices, making them versatile and user-friendly. Developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend, while backend technologies like Golang, Postgres, or Ruby on Rails handle server-side operations. Security, scalability, and responsiveness are key considerations in web app development to ensure a seamless user experience. The ongoing evolution of technologies and frameworks continues to shape the landscape of web application development, enabling the creation of feature-rich and efficient solutions for diverse purposes.
