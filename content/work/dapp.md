Blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) is a software application that operates on a blockchain network, utilizing the principles of decentralization and distributed ledger technology.
Decentralized Application are not controlled by a single entity, but rather run on a decentralized network of nodes, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability of data. Smart contracts, self-executing code on the blockchain, often power these dApps, enabling trustless and tamper-proof transactions. Users can interact with these applications without the need for intermediaries, fostering a more inclusive and efficient ecosystem across various industries, from finance to supply chain management. The decentralized nature of blockchain-based dApps aims to overcome centralization issues and enhance the overall integrity of digital systems.
